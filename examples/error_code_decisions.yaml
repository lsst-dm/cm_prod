description: Lookup table for error codes from PanDA and error logs from science pipelines on HSC-RC2.
legend:
    pandaErrorCode: >
        The error code given by PanDA describing the issue. This is a string describing the type of PanDA
        error followed by a number which gives the specific type of PanDA error.
    diagMessage: This is the diagnostic message given by the PanDA and pipeline logs.
    pipetask: This is the specific pipetask where the error occurred.
    ticket: >
        Any Jira tickets associated with this issue. This can be the processing run where the error
        came up or a ticket associated with fixing a bug.
    resolved: >
        Do we think we have solved this issue? i.e., have we reported and fixed a bug associated with this error?
        This is most useful in cases where the issue seems to have been addressed. If "resolved==True" and the error
        still comes up, we know we missed something and have to stop to look at it.
    rescue: Can the issue associated with this error be solved with a rescue?
    flavor: Where did this error come from? The science pipelines? PanDA? USDF?
    intensity: >
        How many instances of this error may occur before we must stop production and investigate? This float value
        is a percentage. i.e., if "intensity==0.001" then we can lose 0.1% of the data products due to this error.
        If "intensity==0" we have to stop production and investigate with any single occurrence.
